                My First Job
            </h2>
            <p>
                As you may have noticed in the navigation tab,
                I recently became a TA for my COMP 110 class.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have always had a strong passion for teaching and
                imparting my knowledge to others. Becoming a COMP 110 
                TA has given me the chance to make that dream a reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the past few weeks, I have helped students who came
                to office hours learn how to code in TypeScript. The students
                have asked me a wide variety of questions and I am continously
                surprised by the intellectual curiosity that they exhibit.

            <!-- <img src="./pics/face.jpg" align="right" width="300" height="300"> -->
            <p>
                Hello and Welcome to my website!
            </p>
            <p> 
                I am currently an &nbsp; 18 year old CS and Statistics
                major at UNC-Chapel Hill. &nbsp; My interests include: running,
                biking, teaching, and & nbsp; programming. In this
                website you can find &nbsp; information about me, Including what
                I'm working on at &nbsp; the moment.

            <h2>Programming Knowledge</h2>
            <p>
                My current programming skills include:
                <ol>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>TypeScript</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                My dedication to programming &nbsp; drives me to
                learn new languages. I am &nbsp; currently working
                on learning Tableau &nbsp; and R.
            </p>
            <p>
                My strongest asset, currently, is my Knowledge
                of OOP. I have been studying Java for more than
                five years and I've gained a thorough understanding
                of the concepts of Abstraction, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, 
                and inheritance.
