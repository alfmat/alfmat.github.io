              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>
                  Hello and Welcome to my website!
              </p>
              <p>
                  I am currently an 18 year old CS and Statistics
                  major at UNC-Chapel Hill. My interests include: running,
                  biking, teaching, and programming. In this
                  website you can find information about me, Including what
                  I'm working on at the moment.

                  <h2>
                      My First Job
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                      As you may have noticed in the navigation tab,
                      I recently became a TA for my COMP 110 class.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I have always had a strong passion for teaching and
                      imparting my knowledge to others. Becoming a COMP 110
                      TA has given me the chance to make that dream a reality.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Over the past few weeks, I have helped students who came
                      to office hours learn how to code in TypeScript. The students
                      have asked me a wide variety of questions and I am continously
                      surprised by the intellectual curiosity that they exhibit.
