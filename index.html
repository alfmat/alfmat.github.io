    <div id="introductory_text">This is my website where you can find my projects. 
    I am a freshman CS major at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
    One of my favorite hobbies is programming and I try to keep learning new 
    languages whenever I have the chance. Right now I am proficient in:<br>
    1. Java <br>
    2. C++ <br>
    3. Python <br>
    4. HTML <br>
    <br>
    Over the next few months, this webpage will be updated and continously 
    changed. <br></div>

    in javascript, this could be more useful than typing code in the .js file -->

    <button type="button" onclick="displayDate()">Show me the Date</button>
