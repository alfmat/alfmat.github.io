                  My First Job
              </h2>
              <p>
                  As you may have noticed in the navigation tab,
                  I recently became a TA for my COMP 110 class.
              </p>
              <p>
                  I have always had a strong passion for teaching and
                  imparting my knowledge to others. Becoming a COMP 110
                  TA has given me the chance to make that dream a reality.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Over the past few weeks, I have helped students who came
                  to office hours learn how to code in TypeScript. The students
                  have asked me a wide variety of questions and I am continously
                  surprised by the intellectual curiosity that they exhibit.
