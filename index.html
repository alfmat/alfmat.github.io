            <p>
                Hello and Welcome to my website. I am a 18 year old CS
                major at UNC-Chapel Hill. My interests include: running,
                biking, teaching, and programming. I have been at UNC for 
                about a semester an I'm thoroughly enjoying it. In this
                website you can find information about me, Including what
                I'm working on at the moment.

            <h2>Programming Knowledge</h2>
            <p>
                My current programming skills include:
                <ol>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>C++</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                My dedication to programming drives me to
                learn new languages. I am currently working
                on learning Tableau and R.
            </p>
            <p>
                My strongest asset, currently, is my Knowledge
                of OOP. I have been studying Java for more than
                five years and I've gained a thorough understanding
                of the concepts of Abstraction, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, 
                and inheritance.
