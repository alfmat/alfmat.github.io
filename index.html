    I am a freshman CS major at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.<br>
    One of my favorite hobbies is programming and I try to keep learning new <br>
    languages whenever I have the chance. Right now I am proficient in:<br>
    1. Java <br>
    2. C++ <br>
    3. Python <br>
    4. HTML <br>

    Over the next few months, this webpage will be updated and continously 
    changed. <br></p1>
