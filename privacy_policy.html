                    Purpose
                </h4>
                <p>
                    UNC MTC Simplifier is an application developed by the UNC Department of Computer Science.
                    Our goal in creating this application was to simplify the process of converting documents to the Plain Language Format.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a standard used by the federal government for conveying complex medical documents
                    to Americans with reading disabilities. The add-on is geared towards researchers and medical professionals but can be used by anyone with ease.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    User Data Usage
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The following section explains our user data usage and our intentions for asking users for their data. We provide a comprehensive
                    explanation of our intent in order to ensure users of the safety and security of their data.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    What application requests my data?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The UNC MTC Simplifier is the only application in this add-on. Subsequently, this is the only application that
                    requests and utilizes your data. No other application (with the exception of Google Docs itself) has access to any of your data.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    What data does this app use?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The add-on works by accessing the contents of your documents and using the contents to produce a variety of readability
                    metrics. This is the only piece of user data we use. We do not collect your Google email, password, or any other account information.
                    The contents of your document are not stored anywhere or shared with anyone. 
                </p>
                <h5>
                    How is my data used?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    They are used solely to calculate readability metrics and are deleted from our application immediately 
                    after the metrics have been calculated. Here are the metrics we calculate for you using your document contents:
                </p>

                    These are the only metrics that we compute using your documents contents and they are displayed to you immediately in
                    a sidepanel. This information is computed within Google Cloud and not on any external server. Your information thus stays
                    within Google Cloud and Google Docs and is never sent anywhere.

                    Are there any other permissions/data the app uses?

                <p>
                    The only other permission we request from you is the ability to show our application as a sidebar in Google Docs. 
                    This allows us to provide you with timely updates as your document changes when you type.
                </p>

                    Our application computes various metrics for you as you type your document.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to do so, we request access to the contents of your document when you first install our add-on.
                    After this, we periodically take the contents of your document and analyze various metrics.
                    We compute the number of syllables, Flesh-Kincaid, Flesh-Reading, average sentence length, etc. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The computation of these metrics happens within Google Cloud and not on our servers. We
                    do not make copies of your document and store them anywhere. We compute the metrics and conveniently
                    provide them to you in a sidepanel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might notice the add-on periodically refreshing and updating on its own. When this happens it just means
                    that it is attempting to send your document to Google Cloud and then recompute the metrics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only other permission we request from you is to showcase a sidebar in Google Docs. This allows us to quickly
                    and efficiently show you relevant information about your document. We do not use this sidebar to display adds or
                    any other promotional content.

                    As mentioned in the section "What data are we using?" we only access the contents of your document in order to
                    compute readability metrics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By accessing the contents of your documents, we are able to easily calculate Flesh-Kincaid and Flesh-Reading scores
                    which are useful metrics in determining the complexity of your document.

                </h4>
                <p>
                    Feel free to reach out to Gary Bishop: gb at cs.unc.edu or Alfred Mathew: alfmat
                    at live.unc.edu for any comments, concerns, or queries. We would be happy to clarify
                    anything that wasn't clear on the website and we are open to hearing suggestions for improvements
                    to our privacy policy.

                <h4>
                    Q. Why does the add-on need to see my document's contents?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    This add-on's primary purpose is to help users simplify their documents. We do this by
                    computing various readability metrics that help you assess how difficult or easy your
                    document is to understand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Obviously, none of this would be possible if we can't have access to the contents of your document.
                    We can't tell you the word count or syllables/sentence if we can't even see what you've typed out.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Q. Are the contents of my document shared with anyone?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Absolutely No! Even we the developers don't have access to what you've typed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the add-on runs, it copies the text of your document and sends it to Google Cloud.
                    All the computation that figures out how many syllables are in your document or
                    the number of words in your document take place there. This data is not stored or shared with
                    anyone. 
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Q. Do you make a profit from user data?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    In short, we don't! This is because we don't share your data or collect it for ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal with this add-on was to help researchers simplify documents for the CDC.
                    Our project helps Americans with reading disabilities to get access to high-quality informative
                    material that is easy to understand. That's greatest profit that our team is after!
