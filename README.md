This is my personal website! I am currently experimenting with the design
process and hope that this project will be completed soon.

## Challenges that I faced
1. Learning HTML - initially, figuring out how to structure my website
was quite challenging.
2. CSS - I still have work to complete on the styling of my website.

## What's next
At this moment I am focussed on working on the styling of the website.
Creating a clean and usable interface is a top priority for me.
